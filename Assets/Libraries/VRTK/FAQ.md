## Troubleshooting

### I'm using VRTK version 3.0.0 and I've just upgraded my Unity SteamVR Plugin to version 1.2.0 and now I'm getting errors.
  > You will need to upgrade to version 3.0.1 to fix the issue caused by SteamVR 1.2.0.
  It is also required that to do the update, you delete the VRTK directory and re-add it in otherwise Unity may fail to update the files correctly if they are simply copied over and overwrite the old VRTK version 3.0.0 files.

### I've upgraded to VRTK version 3 and I'm getting errors using Unity 5.3.
  > VRTK version 3 does not support Unity 5.3 so you will need to update to Unity 5.4 or above. VRTK aims to only provide support for the recent and current version of Unity (e.g. recent is 5.4 and current is 5.5). VRTK also does not support Unity beta versions.

### I'm using Unity version xx or a beta version of Unity and VRTK is throwing errors.
  > VRTK aims to only provide support for the recent and current version of Unity (e.g. recent is 5.4 and current is 5.5). VRTK also does not support Unity beta versions. If you are on a supported version and still have an issue then raise a bug report on the [VRTK GitHub Issues](https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK/issues) page.

### I've upgraded from VRTK version 2.2.1 to version 3 and many of the VRTK scripts are missing or have changed.

## Getting Started

### Should I be using the [Unity Asset Store version](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/64131) or the [GitHub master version](https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK) of VRTK?
  > The [GitHub master version](https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK) of VRTK is always the most up to date version with more features and bug fixes, however it is not as stable as the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK/releases) or the [Unity Asset Store version](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/64131). It is recommended that to keep up to date with the latest features, the [GitHub master version](https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK) is used.
